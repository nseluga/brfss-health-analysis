# 🧠 BRFSS 2022 Health Data Analysis

A final project for Math 62 at Harvey Mudd College using R and R Markdown to analyze public health survey data from the BRFSS 2022 dataset.

## 👥 Team
Nate Seluga, Alex Seager, Rohan Desai, Emmett Levine

## 📊 Topics Explored
- Asthma rates across urban vs metro regions
- BMI by insurance type (ANOVA)
- Depression and smoking status
- Alcohol use by region, race, age, and income
- Predictors of poor mental health days
- Correlations among chronic conditions

## 🧪 Methods
- Proportion tests (`prop.test`)
- T-tests and ANOVA (`aov`)
- Multiple linear regression (`lm`)
- Correlation matrices
- Categorical variable engineering and visualization

## 📁 Files
- `Math62_Final_Project.Rmd` – full analysis
- Optional: HTML or PDF output from knitting the `.Rmd`

## 🧠 Key Insight
General health status was the strongest predictor of mental health outcomes, explaining nearly 49% of variation in reported poor mental health days—more than income, employment, or binge drinking status.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- R
- R Markdown
- dplyr, ggplot2, base R
